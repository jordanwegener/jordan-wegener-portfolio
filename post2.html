            Rails project retrospective (post-mortem?)
          </h1>
          <p class="single-post-text">
            Well, our major rails project is done. What a task it was,
            especially since I sort of started off on the wrong foot.
          </p>
          <p class="single-post-text">
            I managed to get seriously sick in the second week of term, when we
            were right in the middle of learning Rails. This really set me back
            as when I was ready to join in again, I was already behind and
            trying to catch up. By the time our major Rails assignment came
            around I was probably still 2-3 weeks behind... so I started trying
            to learn most of Rails at the same time as building my first two-way
            marketplace app.
          </p>
          <p class="single-post-text">
            I guess it was a test of my ability to absorb information quickly in
            order and figure out a language or framework quickly. I didn't do
            too badly in the end considering the start I had, and by the end I
            felt like I was getting the hang of Rails and getting into a bit of
            a flow. I only wish I'd been able to start that way! There's
            definitely a lot of features missing from the final product, which I
            think I'll continue to work on and improve as a portfolio item. It's
            functional, just not how I'd like it to be.

            If it doesn't load initially give it a second, Heroku likes to put
            hosted apps to sleep when nobody's accessed them for a while
            (GigBoard is not exactly a hive of activity).
