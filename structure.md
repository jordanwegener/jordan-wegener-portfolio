# Design

- Consistency with buttons/call to action
- Dark theme - dark grey background (#121212)
- Mostly dark shades/dark teal with bright accents to draw attention
- Material design principles - 'higher' elements lighter
- Desaturated colours to improve legibility
- Don't use bright colours for large surfaces
- [Button hovers/clicks](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PQ-iI90IHUbjxzioTnUxHWG3Ocla_R2TQO5Iim9JhJyoyz97Eit3Dm0azt9Hzm_zt8kqlyfboxdJe5-6a2JDj-CZX8ITb2mUdZ2X6Os=w1064-v0)

Research log

Browsing examples on Dribble and https://www.dtelepathy.com/blog/inspiration/23-great-examples-of-innovative-navigation-for-your-inspiration found that most navbars don't have opaque backgrounds

Might use a smaller navbar and footer vertically. Takes up a lot of screen space

Background image is square in proportions. Will need to fit width on desktop and fit height on mobile

Paginated/swipe pages - might be difficult. Can try using a javascript library but if I run out of time I'll just use a scrolling layout. Swiper js library - might be able to use this.
